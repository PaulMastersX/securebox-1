#genericDrv:
genericDrvIN_write(): 
  - if GDRV_BUFOUT_SZ < GDRV_BUFIN_SZ, it is possible to saturate GDRV_BUFOUT_SZ
    before GDRV_BUFIN_SZ. If it happens, genericDrvIN_write() will fill the input
    buffer with data and wont be able to retrieve it or cancel the operation using
    the ringBuffer existing API. 
    Solution: expand the ringBuffer API to support buffer checks(maybe an additional
    parameter or a whole new function).

#simple_queue:
  - delete function and SPop():
    - if delete() is implemented, and the current buffer uses SPop(), it wont work,
      and data will not be secure.
      Solution: implement a SDelete() for cases when SPop() is used, and a regular
      delete().
  - thread safety with soft head:
    - implement a soft head pointer to make soft writes to the queue and a function
      to pass the value of soft head to hard head. this last operation is atomic in
      nature. It will work as long as there is only ONE input source.
